Progress Log
============

- 2025-12-11: DevPlan1 reviewer fixes applied. Priority helper defaults to HIGH with optional REALTIME flag; queue handling now uses queue.Empty/queue.Full; torchaudio `list_audio_backends` shim documented for torchaudio 2.9/speechbrain; channel layout heuristic documented; added WaveformerSeparator unit tests (assets missing, invalid target, resample, query vector); README expanded with setup, architecture, mixer usage. Tests: `python -m pytest desktop/tests -q`.
Progress Log
============

- 2025-12-11: DevPlan0 (Project Setup) completed end-to-end. We initialized Git with LFS, built the prescribed folder structure, and stood up a Python 3.11 venv with all dependencies (PyTorch, TF, ONNX, TFLite/CoreML tooling, audio libs). Added GitHub Actions Python CI (tests + coverage) and wired `.gitignore`, `.gitattributes`, `pyproject.toml`, VS Code settings, and README. Downloaded Waveformer experiment checkpoints and YAMNet model assets via helper script. Ran smoke tests: patched Waveformer CLI for modern PyTorch/torchaudio (soundfile I/O, backend stub, weights_only fix) and verified inference output; YAMNet loaded via TFHub fallback with class-map present. Unexpected items: torchaudio 2.9 removed `list_audio_backends` and added torchcodec dependency—handled by stubbing backend and using soundfile for I/O. TensorFlow lacked `tf.signal.resample` in this build—switched to SciPy resample. Deviations: minimal; CI uses Py 3.11 (plan suggested 3.10) to match local env, and YAMNet test uses TFHub fallback instead of the local tar.gz because TFHub archive lacks a saved_model manifest. Outcome: all DevPlan0 checklist items satisfied; ready to begin DevPlan1 Audio Mixer.

- 2025-12-11: DevPlan1 Audio Mixer foundation implemented end-to-end. Delivered Waveformer inference wrapper (training) with desktop shim, PyAudio I/O + OS priority helper, multiprocessing audio process (ring buffers, gain smoothing), MixerController lifecycle wrapper, CLI smoke test (`desktop/src/test_mixer.py`), and docs in README. Added desktop requirements and psutil to training requirements. Unit tests added for ring buffer, gain smoother, and controller with fake backend/separator; all tests now passing via `python -m pytest desktop/tests -q` in the project venv. Torchaudio `list_audio_backends` stubbed in desktop inference shim to keep speechbrain imports compatible with torchaudio 2.9. Verified end-to-end test run post-install of desktop requirements.
